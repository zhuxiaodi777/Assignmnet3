Introdution
This project was to create a healthcare system.
Users or patients could reserve with a doctor in the nearest hospital.
Doctors could log in to their unique accounts to review the patients’ bookings. Doctors could also write an encounter for each patient, including temperature, blood pressure, etc. And Doctors could CRUD encounter histories.
Community administrators could log in to add a hospital in their community if there is a new one. And they could also CRUD information about hospitals.
The system admin is the only one that could CRUD all branch systems’ information, including users, doctors, and community administrators. 

Run
This proejct was written on Netbeans by Java.
